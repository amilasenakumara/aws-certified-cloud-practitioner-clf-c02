# ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) Notes

## üåê Types of Cloud Computing

AWS provides different types of cloud computing models:

### 1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- Provides **raw building blocks**:  
  - Networking  
  - Virtual servers (compute)  
  - Storage  
- High flexibility, similar to building with **LEGOs**.  
- Ideal for migrating from traditional on-premises IT to the cloud.  
- Examples:
  - **AWS:** Amazon EC2  
  - **Others:** Google Cloud, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode  

### 2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- AWS manages the **underlying infrastructure** (servers, storage, networking).  
- You manage only:
  - Applications  
  - Data  
- Simplifies deployment and management of applications.  
- Examples:
  - **AWS:** Elastic Beanstalk  
  - **Others:** Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure  

### 3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
- Fully managed by AWS or provider.  
- You just use the software; no infrastructure management needed.  
- Examples:
  - **AWS:** Rekognition (Machine Learning service)  
  - **Others:** Gmail, Dropbox, Zoom

## üí∞ AWS Pricing Fundamentals

AWS pricing is **pay-as-you-go**:

1. **Compute** ‚Äì pay for exact compute time used.  
2. **Storage** ‚Äì pay for exact amount of data stored.  
3. **Networking** ‚Äì pay only when data **leaves the cloud**; data coming in is free.  

**Benefit:** Huge cost savings compared to traditional IT.
