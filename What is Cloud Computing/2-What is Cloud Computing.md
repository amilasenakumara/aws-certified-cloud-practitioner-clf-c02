# ☁️ AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) – Cloud Computing Lecture Notes

## Introduction to Cloud Computing

- **Definition:** Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of:
  - Compute power 💻
  - Database storage 🗄️
  - Applications 📦
  - Other IT resources ⚙️
- **Key concept:** **On-demand** – you get resources exactly when you need them.
- **Pricing model:** **Pay-as-you-go** 💰
  - Only pay for what you request and use.
  - Stop paying when resources are no longer needed.
- **Provisioning flexibility:**
  - Choose exact type and size of computing resources.
  - Add or remove resources instantly.
- **Access:** Immediate provisioning without prior notice.

## AWS Cloud Overview

- AWS owns and maintains the network-connected hardware.
- Users provision and use resources via a web interface.
- Traditional IT vs Cloud:
  - Traditional: Build your own data center 🏢
  - Cloud: Use AWS data centers, pay only for what you use.
- Everyday examples of cloud services:
  - Gmail 📧 (email cloud service)
  - Dropbox 🗂️ (cloud storage service)
  - Netflix 🎥 (video on-demand cloud service)
- Dropbox was originally built on AWS.

## Types of Cloud Computing

### 1️⃣ Private Cloud

- Cloud services for **a single organization**.
- Managed by a third party (e.g., Rackspace) or internally.
- Offers **higher security** for sensitive applications.
- Full control over resources.

### 2️⃣ Public Cloud

- Cloud resources owned and operated by **third-party providers**.
- Delivered over the Internet 🌐
- Examples:
  - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  - Microsoft Azure
  - Google Cloud
- Key advantage: **On-demand access** and cost efficiency.

### 3️⃣ Hybrid Cloud

- Combination of **private and public cloud**.
- Keep some servers on-premises and extend capabilities into the cloud.
- Benefits:
  - Control over sensitive assets 🛡️
  - Flexibility and cost-effectiveness 💵
